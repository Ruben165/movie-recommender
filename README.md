Don't know what to watch?  
Tried to search all over the place, but to no avail?  

STOP whatever you're doing and come look at THIS!!!  

With this app, you don't have to search for anymore movies/shows yourself.  

We'll give recommendations to you with just a click of a button.

After that, just let the magic does the trick and you'll be having fun watching again.  

So, what are you waiting for?  

Download "App Name" on your device with this link:  

We've made this app with "user-friendly" as our objective.  

So, you won't have a hard time using and navigating the app.

When you open it, the app prompts open and it will show the main menu.  

After clicking the "Recommend Me A Movie!", the program will try to search for a random movie/show from a movie API.

After that, the window will change to one that shows the result, i.e. the recommended movie/show, along with some details about it.

If the current one is not to your liking, don't worry.

Just click the button "Again?" and it will give you another result.

After you found the one you've taken interest in, you can click the "Back to Main Menu" button and close the app as you usually close a window.

It's super easy!!!
